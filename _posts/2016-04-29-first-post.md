## First Post!
This will be my first post here. I'll be mostly talking about my new takes on life, what I learned new, and also, my Google Summer of Code updates.
I'll be working as a student developer for [Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science](http://publiclab.org/) this summer.


##A little about me
I'm a web developer originally from Mumbai, and I am an undergraduate 2nd year at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. I love to explore new places and try local cuisine, and have frequented many such trips in Mumbai. I have a Jackson guitar and love to play AC/DC songs. The art of origami fascinates me. Someday, I would like to settle in Japan.
