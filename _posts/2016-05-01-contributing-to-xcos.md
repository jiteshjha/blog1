### What is Xcos?
Xcos is a graphical editor for designing hybrid dynamical systems models in Scilab, just like Simulink in Matlab, but an open-source alternative.


### About the web part
FOSSEE, IIT Bombay has taken an initiative to port Xcos to a standalone web application. This means, it wont be necessary to install Scilab (Size  ~180MB for Ubuntu version, which is pretty big considering our average downloading speed in India) to use Xcos, just a URL and a browser would do fine.


### My role in this
I'm going to help in porting xcos to the web this summer 2016 with a team of 4, as an open source contribution, along with Google Summer of Code. It is a daunting task, yes, but not unachievable. I probably have to cut down on Movies and TV Shows, but that's okay. I am going to work at IIT Bombay, which is an hour Train ride from my house.


### The fun part
Before getting selected for IIT Bombay Xcos project and Google Summer of Code, I had decided to search for work in Navi Mumbai, and I had no plans in relocating to a different city just to work as an intern in some startup. But with IIT Bombay and GSoC selection, I couldn't be more elated. I can work in my favorite city, Mumbai! and my mentor at IIT Bombay doesn't mind me going home after assigning me tasks, as long as I'm able to meet the deadline. How fun is that! That's like a dream internship.


### The downsides
Unfortunately, I had plans for picking up driving skills and also diving into Machine Learning thought the book, Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran. I don't think I'll be in the position to embark into these things. Also, I won't be able to undergo my food trips to Mumbai, and learn some more German, but that's okay, there's no love pure than the love for coding.


### Placement
Four companies - Microsft, Cisco, Amazon and Sandisk would be coming to our college after the first week of August. I'd really like to give a shot to the interviews. I'll choose L33tcode and GeeksForGeeks for interview preparation, I dislike the length of the questions on SPOJ and Codechef, in my opinion. Hackerrank has a pretty UI, and to-the-point questions, but Leetcode and GeeksForGeeks are good enough for interview preparation. I'll be also reading the technical interview Bible, Cracking the Coding Interview.


### Conclusion
It'll be a great summer of coding, and I'm looking forward to it. :)
